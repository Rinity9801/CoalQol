Coal QOL - Emissive Coal Ore Resource Pack

This resource pack makes coal ore blocks glow in the dark using emissive textures.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Entity Texture Features (ETF) mod: https://modrinth.com/mod/entitytexturefeatures
- This works with Sodium/Iris if you use those

HOW TO USE:
1. Install Entity Texture Features mod
2. Extract this 'coal_emissive' folder to your resourcepacks folder
3. Enable it in Minecraft's Resource Packs menu
4. Coal ore will now have a glowing effect!

Note: You still need to see the block for it to glow - this doesn't reveal hidden ores.
This is a client-side visual effect only.
